This is a brief decscription of model sets that existed in the xdata directory.  Many can be deleted.

This directory is more generally to be used for test models

CIIICIVCV\_c10.dat - macro atom data sets which Kiera made for testing
CIIICIVCV\_c10\_CV1LVL.dat - macro atom data sets which Kiera made for testing
CIIICIV\_c10.dat - macro atom data sets which Kiera made for testing
c\_4to6.dat - test macro atom sets which Stuart made from his X-rah modelling
c\_4to6\_o\_6to8.dat - test macro atom sets which Stuart made from his X-rah modelling
fe\_23to27.dat - intermediate historical attempt for x-ray data
h10\_hetop10.dat - diagnositic with other lines similar to Standard 80
h10\_hetop\_lohe1\_standard80.dat - diagnostic with other lines similar to Standard 80, only one level of he1, 10 of 2.  Delete?
h10\_hetop\_only.dat - Just H and He (other elements commmented out in elemem ion file
h10\_hetop\_standard80.dat - Reduced from similar with h20.  Deleted
h10\_standard80.dat - H but no helium macro atom
h20.dat - pure H 
h20\_hetop\_no\_recomb.dat - To force Milne relation.
h3\_hetop3.dat - 3 H and 3 He (delete soon)
h\_only.dat - Pure H. no macro.  (Delete)
standard80\_sn\_kurucz.dat - To be moved to data-release repository
standard80\_test.dat - Very old (Delete)
