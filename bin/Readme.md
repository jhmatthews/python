python/bin README

====================

This is where binaries are stored once versions of python have been compiled using make.

Setup_Py_Dir can be used to set up the links to the data directories in a given working folder.


This should be set up with your bash configuration file (or similar)
export PYTHON=/path/to/python
PATH=${PATH}:$PYTHON/bin
export PATH
