This directory contains python scripts for use with the C code python...confusing, huh...

Docs for the scripts are generated automatically using the script write_docs. It can be rerun by cding to py_progs then running

./write_docs.py . html_docs py_progs

This will create a master html file doc_py_progs.html which links to html in the dubdirect html_docs.
