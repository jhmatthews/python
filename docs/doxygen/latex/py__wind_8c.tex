Arguments\+:

py\+\_\+wind \mbox{[}-\/h\mbox{]} \mbox{[}-\/s\mbox{]} \mbox{[}-\/p parameter\+\_\+file\mbox{]} \mbox{[}root\mbox{]}

where
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item -\/h prints out a short help file and exits (see help routine below)
\item -\/s causes certain parameters in the windsave file to be printed out as individual ascii files after which the program exits
\item -\/d In cases where a windsavefile was made for each ionization cycle, this prints out ascii files for \char`\"{}certain\char`\"{} parameters for each of the ionization cycles, as well as the ascii files for the final ionization cycle (if windsave files for each ionization cycle were not created then -\/s and -\/d are equivalent).
\item -\/p parameter file Instead of reading the choices from the command line read them from a parameter file root optional root name of wind\+\_\+save file. If this is not given, the user is queried for this
\end{DoxyItemize}

Description\+:

Py\+\_\+wind simply reads and then displays portions of the wind file created by python. It can select various parameters from the wind and it can write them to files so that the variables can be plotted.

The normal mode of running py\+\_\+wind is to run it interactively. As you run it interactively the variables you select are displayed ont the screen. The variables that you display can also be written to files (depending on the answer to the question Make\+\_\+files)

The commands that were executed in the interactive will be stored in py\+\_\+wind.\+pf (if you end with a \char`\"{}q\char`\"{}, and not an E\+OF response to the choice question) E\+OF terminates the program at that point before the command file is written to py\+\_\+wind.\+pf

The py\+\_\+wind.\+pf file is useful if you want to run the exact same set of commands on another windfile. You should rename py\+\_\+wind.\+pf to something\+\_\+else.\+pf and run py\+\_\+wind on that data set using the -\/p something\+\_\+else.\+pf option

The command\+\_\+line switches -\/d and -\/s are intended to produce a standard set of output files sufficient for many purposes.

\paragraph*{Notes}

The files that are produced can contain either the original gridding which was used by python, in which case the file prefix will be \char`\"{}x.\char`\"{}, or \char`\"{}z\char`\"{}, in which case it will be regridded to a linear array. This option is intended so one can create a contour plot more easily.

The structure of py\+\_\+wind is intended to make it easy to add additional variables to print to the scen or a file. Basically to add a new option, one needs to update the list of possibilities, add a new choice statement in one\+\_\+choice, and then write the routine that grabs a new variable (or calculates a value from several), and add this to either py\+\_\+wind\+\_\+subs or py\+\_\+wind\+\_\+macro\+\_\+subs.

Because this was intended as a diagnositic routine, some of the more esoteric choices may seem a bit odd today.

I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+NT\+: py\+\_\+wind has not been adapted to handle multiple domains. Use windsave2table instead.

py\+\_\+wind is a program which can be used to display various parameters of a wind as calculated by python. This is the main routine 


\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}

The command\+\_\+line switches -\/d and -\/s are intended to produce a standard set of output files sufficient for many purposes.

The main routine gets the input data, and repeately presents the user with a set of choices (in interactive mode) until the users dicides she has had enough. The case statements that are used to select what to do based on user inputs are (now) contained in the subroutine one\+\_\+choice

\paragraph*{Notes}

The files that are produced can contain either the original gridding which was used by python, in which case the file prefix will be \char`\"{}x.\char`\"{}, or \char`\"{}z\char`\"{}, in which case it will be regridded to a linear array. This option is intended so one can create a contour plot more easily.

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em char} & choice A character indicating the variable to be displayed \\

The routine simply contains a large case statement for interpreting what to do based on the variable choice

In some cases, additional imputs are required.

print out some helpful information to the screen and exits

N/A since the program exits once the help is written
\end{DoxyReturn}
This routine simply writes information to the screen. It should be updated whenever the program changes in a major way.

It is called if py\+\_\+wind is invoked with -\/h, or if there if it is given a switch that it does not understand.

\paragraph*{Notes}

Unfortunately unlike python the program language c is not self documenting
