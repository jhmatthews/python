\subsection{Detailed Description}
A standalone routine for writing a standard set of data from a windsavefile to ascii tables all readable with as astropy.\+io.\+ascii.

This routine is run from the command line, as follows

windsave2table windsave\+\_\+root

where windsave\+\_\+root is the root name for a python run, or more precisel the rootname of a windsave file.

The routine reads the windsavefile and then writes out a selected set of variables into a variety of number of files, each of which are readable as astropy tables, where each row corresponds to one element of the wind.

All of the files begin with the rootname and the domain number. If Python run that created the windsave file has multiple domains a sepearate output file is created for each domain

All of the files, begin with \begin{DoxyVerb}   x        z    i    j inwind 
\end{DoxyVerb}


where x and z correspond to the position of the cell, i and j correspond to the cell number and inwind says whether the cell was in the wind, so that it is fairly straightforward to create plotting routines for various parameters that are contained in the remaining columns.

The files include a so-\/called masterfile which records basic parameters like n\+\_\+e, velocity, rho, t\+\_\+e, t\+\_\+r, and ionization fractions for a few key ions in each cell when the windsave file was written

\paragraph*{Notes}

Whereas py\+\_\+wind is intended to be run interactively, windsave2table is entirely hardwired so that it produces a standard set of output files. To change the outputs one has to modify the routine

This file just contains the driving routine. All of the real work is carried out in \hyperlink{windsave2table__sub_8c}{windsave2table\+\_\+sub.\+c} Indeed so little of the real work is done here that it might be sensible to move some portion of that code here.

windsave2table writes key variables in a windsave file to an astropy table calculated Python. This is the main routine. 


\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em int} & argc The number of argments in the command line \\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em char} & $\ast$ argv\mbox{[}\mbox{]} The command line \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
Always returns 0, unless the windsave file is not found in which case the routine will issue and error before exiting.
\end{DoxyReturn}
argc and argv\mbox{[}\mbox{]} are the standard variables provided to main in a c-\/program. Only the first command line argument is parsed and this should be rootname of the windsave file

\paragraph*{Notes}

This routine is a supervisory routine. The real work is in do\+\_\+windsave2table

The routine does not read the .pf file. It does read the windsave file and the associated atomic data file before calling do\+\_\+windsave2table.
