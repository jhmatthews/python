\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains the routines which translate photons, both inside and outside of the domains.

Except for translating the photon the routines do as litle as possible w.\+r.\+t modifying any of the other information in the photon structure.

There is a steering routine translate which calle either translate\+\_\+in\+\_\+wind or translate\+\_\+in\+\_\+space, depending on whether a photon bundle is in a wind domain or in space. The routines translate the photon until hits something, either the edge of the wind, or the edge of a cell, or a resonance and then return with a status noting what has happened.

\paragraph*{Notes}

Some of these routines pass the Wind\+Ptor for the entire wind which should not be necessary and had been removed in favor of using wmain. It would probably be a good idea to that here.

These routines are called from trans\+\_\+phot. One could argue that the filename is misnamed for that reason.

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
The distance to the nearest boundary of the wind and the domain for which the boudary applies.
\end{DoxyReturn}
Python defines the boundaries of the wind in term of the intersection of a biconical flow (defined by an inner and outer windcone) and an inner and outer radius centered on the star. If the user is interested in a biconical flow, he/she will most likely set the radii so that they do not truncate the wind. Similarly, by choosing parameters for the windcones properly, one can assure that one has a completely spherical flow. However, the user may also perversely set the parameters to that both the conical flow boundaries and the min and maximum radius come into play.

Usually, one would efine the two types of The two types of boundaries are sually defined so that one includes the other and so the cones apply when one is ealing with a CV type wind, while the inner and outer radius applies for a spherical odel. However this routine does not require this to be the case, since it just alculates where the edges are.

n any event, if you are inside the wind already ds\+\_\+to\+\_\+wind calculates the distance to the edge of the wind. If you are outside, It will also be to the nearest edge.

The routine distinguishes between two basic cases. Either the photon is already in the wind in which case one looks for the nearest boundary, or the photon is not currently in the wind and you have to translate it until it reaches the the boundary (or V\+E\+R\+Y\+\_\+\+B\+IG)

\paragraph*{Notes}

There is no guarantee that you will still be in the region defined by the grid.

This is inefficient, and needs to be corrected for rtheta and spherical models which can easily be handled using wind cones.\end{DoxyRefDesc}

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}

\end{DoxyReturn}
The routine takes the current position of the photon and determines where it is. Depending on this it calls either translate\+\_\+in\+\_\+space or translate\+\_\+in\+\_\+wind

On exit, the position of the photon will have been updated.

\paragraph*{Notes}

Translate controls the flow of the photon through one grid cell. In Python, there are additional possibilities since there are wind free regions.

The routine first calls where\+\_\+in\+\_\+wind which returns the correct domain for a given position, or domain 0 if the position is not in the wind of a domain. The photon structure does not have the domain number directly encoded, but it can be obtained from the grid number, which where in\+\_\+grid updates

This construction is used so that the calling routines for translate (trans\+\_\+phot and extract) can be the same in the 1 and 2d versions.

These last two quantities are calculated in ds\+\_\+calculate and simply passed back.

translate\+\_\+in\+\_\+wind returns that status directly to the calling routine.

In addition to moving the photon, the routine also updates some values having to do with the radiation filed both in and out of macro atom mode.

\item The status is undeterminable 5
\end{DoxyItemize}

If a photon does not fall into one of these categories, walls returns the old status, which is stored in p-\/$>$istat

walls is generally called after one has calculated how far a photon can travel in a cell in order to see whether it has exited the wind region. This is necessary because some grid cells are not actually part of the wind, even though they are needed so that the grid is regular.

pold is the place where the photon was before the last attempt to move the photon forward. p on input is a proposed location for photon before considering whethe one has hit a boundary. The location of p is either at the edge of a cell, or at the position of a resonance. So pold should be a valid position for the photon, but p may need to be adjusted.

If one of the walls has been hit, the routine should have moved the photon to that wall, but not othewise changed it.

The routine also calculates the normal to the surface that was hit, which is inteneded to be used by trans\+\_\+phot to redirect the photon

\paragraph*{Notes}

This really does determine whether the photon is in the grid, as opposed to whether the photon has reached a radial distance geo.\+rwind. I am not sure whether this is what we want???.
