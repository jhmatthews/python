<dd>1802 -ksl - At present this routine for imported models this routine only deals with cylindrical models. Additionally for imported models we skip all of the of the wind_cones. This is inefficient, and needs to be corrected for rtheta and spherical models which can easily be handled using wind cones. </dd>

The routines are in <a class="el" href="diag_8c.html" title="consolidates an approach to providing extra diagnositcs for debugging python, Some of the diagnostics...">diag.c</a> It is not clear that they have been used in a long time and so it may be worthwhile to remove them. Furthermore, we have established a new mechanism save_phot for essentially this same task. This really should be consolidated. </p>
<p class="enddd">This is also commented in the text, but there is a rather bizarre separation for where the photon frequency is updated and where the weight is update. The former is done in extract, while the latter is done in extract_one. This is not an error precisely but makes the code more confusing than it needs to be. </p>

<dd>It is not obvious that this is really what we want. This routine was written when we only were concerned about scattering and does not really take into account emission (for which one needs n_e.

<dd>Our long term goal is to make our inputs for radiation sources more generic, but there is still more work to do on this routine. The problems are really to first define what we want. Implementation should be straighforwad if we can figure out what we want. A first step might be to break this into two routines, one for a BL and one for an AGN. Note that the AGN also is used for a BH binary. This routine was clipped out of python at one pooint so it is not surprising it does not make logical sense to have grouped these itimes together </dd>

<dd>The model structure is general in the sense that it was intended for situation with any number of variables. However what is written here is specific to the case of two variables.

<dd><p class="startdd">180414 - ksl - It is not obvious that using DFUDGE as the way to choose whether to recalculate the cdf for scatter is correct. One would obtain the wrong answer if the photon moved a small distance and hit a different resonance. </p>

It might be better to move even more of the running of the code to here. Alternatively, one might make <a class="el" href="python_8c.html" title="This file contains main and various related routines that are central to the operation of Python...">python.c</a> simpler, so that developers could see the structure better, but moving the input section into it's own file. </dd>
